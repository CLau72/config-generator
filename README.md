# Config File Generator

## Overview

FactoryTalk Network Manager uses FreeMarker templates in order to fill in values for switch configurations. This script is designed to read in a template file, determine the variables,
and generate individual configuration files. The goal is to make it so I only have to write one Stratix configuration, and then spit out one for every lab station I manage.
